# Session 4

Welcome to the fifth session of the Introduction to Programming training! In this session, we covered more foundational concepts in C++ programming related to Arrays and Strings.


## Topics Covered

Here are some of the key topics we will cover in this session:

## Data Structures and Fundamental Data Types

### Arrays

* **Definition:** Arrays are a collection of data items of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. They allow efficient access and manipulation of data.

* **Key Characteristics:**
    * Fixed size: Arrays have a predetermined size that cannot be changed dynamically during program execution.
    * Indexed access: Elements in an array are accessed using indices, which start from 0.

### Strings

* **Definition:** Strings are sequences of characters, typically used to represent text. They are treated as special arrays of characters.

* **Key Characteristics:**
    * Variable length: Strings can grow or shrink as needed during program execution.
    * Null-terminated: Strings are typically terminated by a null character ('\0') to indicate the end of the string.

### Primitive vs. User-Defined Data Types

* **Primitive Data Types:**
    * Basic data types provided by the programming language.
    * Examples: integers, floating-point numbers, characters, booleans.

* **User-Defined Data Types:**
    * Custom data types created by the programmer using programming constructs.
    * Examples: structures, classes, enumerations.

### Multi-Dimensional Arrays

* **Definition:** Arrays with more than one dimension, allowing data organization in a grid-like structure.

* **Applications:**
    * Representing images or matrices.
    * Storing data with multiple levels of categorization.

### Runtime Errors: Out-of-Bound

* **Description:** An error that occurs when accessing an element outside the valid range of an array or string.

* **Prevention:**
    * Using proper indexing within the valid range.
    * Implementing boundary checks to validate indices before accessing elements.

### Introduction to Data Structures

* **Definition:** Data structures are organized collections of data that provide efficient access, insertion, and deletion of data elements.

* **Types of Data Structures:**
    * Linear data structures: Lists, queues, stacks.
    * Non-linear data structures: Trees, graphs (we didn't talk about these yet).

* **Importance of Data Structures:**
    * Efficient data organization and retrieval.
    * Algorithm design and implementation.
    * Developing scalable and performant software applications.
