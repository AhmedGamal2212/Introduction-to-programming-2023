# Session 4

Welcome to the fourth session of the Introduction to Programming training! In this session, we covered more foundational concepts in C++ programming. These concepts are crucial for building a strong understanding of the language and its core principles as well.


## Topics Covered

Here are some of the key topics we will cover in this session:

## Programming Building Blocks

### Loops

Loops are control flow statements that allow a block of code to be executed repeatedly until a certain condition is met. They are essential for performing repetitive tasks efficiently.

### Built-in Functions

Built-in functions are predefined functions that are provided by the programming language and can be used without needing to define them explicitly. They provide a wide range of functionalities, such as mathematical operations, input/output operations, and string manipulation.

#### Example C++ Built-in Functions:

* `pow(x, y)`: Calculates the power of x raised to the power of y.
* `sqrt(x)`: Calculates the square root of x.
* `abs(x)`: Calculates the absolute value of x.

### Custom Functions

Custom functions are functions that we define ourselves to encapsulate specific tasks or functionalities. They promote code modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

### Return Statements

Return statements are used to specify the value that a function returns. They allow functions to provide output or data to the calling code.


### Parameters vs Arguments

Parameters are the variables declared within a function definition, while arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is called. Parameters act as placeholders for the arguments.


### Use Cases for Programming Building Blocks

#### Loops:

* Iterating through a collection of data, such as an array or a list.
* Performing repetitive computations based on a condition.

#### Built-in Functions:

* Performing common mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* Handling input/output operations, such as reading user input or writing data to a file.
* Manipulating strings, such as searching for characters, extracting substrings, and converting between uppercase and lowercase.

#### Custom Functions:

* Encapsulating specific tasks or functionalities to improve code organization and readability.
* Promoting code reusability by avoiding code duplication.
* Enhancing code maintainability by making it easier to modify or extend existing functionality.

#### Return Statements:

* Providing output or data from functions to the calling code.
* Facilitating data exchange between different parts of a program.
* Returning specific values based on function logic or input parameters.

#### Parameters and Arguments:

* Providing input data to functions for specific computations or operations.
* Customizing function behavior based on the provided arguments.
* Encapsulating data within functions to control access and maintain data integrity.
